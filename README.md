# Email-Spam-Detection
This project aims to develop an email spam detection system using machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). Implemented text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier on the preprocessed data to classify emails. Evaluated the model's performance with an accuracy of 97.00%, precision of 98% for non-spam and 93% for spam, recall of 99% for non-spam and 86% for spam, and an F1-score of 98% for non-spam and 89% for spam, indicating high performance in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.
